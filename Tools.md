- [KAPE](https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/kroll-artifact-parser-extractor-kape)

_KAPE (Kroll Artifact Parser And Extractor) is a live data acquisition and analysis tool which can be used to acquire registry data. It is primarily a command-line tool but also comes with a GUI._ 
- [Autopsy](https://www.autopsy.com/)

_Autopsy gives you the option to acquire data from both live systems or from a disk image. After adding your data source, navigate to the location of the files you want to extract, then right-click and select the Extract File(s) option._

- [FTK Image](https://www.exterro.com/ftk-imager)

_FTK Imager is similar to Autopsy and allows you to extract files from a disk image or a live system by mounting the said disk image or drive in FTK Imager. Another way you can extract Registry files from FTK Imager is through the Obtain Protected Files option. This option is only available for live systems_

# Tools to Exploring Windows Registry

- [AccessData's Registry Viewer](https://accessdata.com/product-download/registry-viewer-2-0-0)
- [Zimmerman's Registry Explorer](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md)

_Eric Zimmerman has developed a handful of tools that are very useful for performing Digital Forensics and Incident Response. One of them is the Registry Explorer.  It can load multiple hives simultaneously and add data from transaction logs into the hive to make a more 'cleaner' hive with more up-to-date data. It also has a handy 'Bookmarks' option containing forensically important registry keys often sought by forensics investigators. Investigators can go straight to the interesting registry keys and values with the bookmarks menu item._ 

- [RegRipper](https://github.com/keydet89/RegRipper3.0)

_RegRipper is a utility that takes a registry hive as input and outputs a report that extracts data from some of the forensically important keys and values in that hive. The output report is in a text file and shows all the results in sequential order.RegRipper is available in both a CLI and GUI form_
